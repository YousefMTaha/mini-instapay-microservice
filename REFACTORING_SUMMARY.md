# NestJS Microservices Refactoring Project

## Overview
This project focused on refactoring a NestJS microservices application to replace all `any` types with proper TypeScript types, and implementing comprehensive unit tests. The application is a banking system with multiple microservices handling different aspects of the application.

## Main Changes

### Type Refactoring

1. **User Service**
   - Added proper types for all controller and service methods
   - Created interfaces for API request payloads
   - Replaced `any` with `userType` and other specific types

2. **Transaction Service**
   - Replaced all `any` types in controllers and services
   - Created dedicated type definition files for User, Account, and Transaction
   - Fixed method parameter types and return types
   - Resolved linter errors related to ObjectId conversions

3. **Notification Service**
   - Implemented proper typing for notification data
   - Added interfaces for users, accounts, and transactions
   - Refactored WebSocket gateway to use Socket.io types

4. **Mail Service**
   - Added interface for email payload

5. **Validators**
   - Updated custom validators to use specific types instead of `any`

### Unit Tests Implementation

1. **User Controller Tests**
   - Created comprehensive tests for all controller endpoints
   - Included proper mocking of service methods
   - Tested both successful and error scenarios

2. **User Service Tests**
   - Implemented unit tests for all service methods
   - Created mocks for MongoDB models and external services
   - Covered edge cases and error handling

3. **Transaction Controller Tests**
   - Added tests for key transaction operations (send money, get history, change default account)
   - Implemented proper mocking of dependent services
   - Tested both success and failure scenarios

4. **Transaction Service Tests**
   - Created unit tests for critical transaction operations
   - Tested money transfer logic and validation
   - Verified error handling for various scenarios

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Type Safety**
   - Eliminated runtime type errors
   - Better IDE autocompletion and suggestions
   - Clearer function signatures and interfaces
   - Proper TypeScript type checking during builds

2. **Better Code Maintainability**
   - Self-documenting code with proper types
   - Easier to understand data flow between services
   - Improved developer experience

3. **Enhanced Testing**
   - Comprehensive test coverage for APIs
   - Validation of business logic
   - Protection against regressions

## Resolved Issues

1. **ObjectId Type Conversions**
   - Fixed type mismatches between MongoDB ObjectId and string parameters
   - Added proper toString() conversions where required
   - Resolved linter errors related to type compatibility

2. **Socket.io Types**
   - Improved WebSocket code with proper Socket.io type definitions
   - Enhanced real-time notification functionality

3. **Validation Types**
   - Updated custom validators with proper parameter types
   - Improved error handling in validation logic

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Test Implementation**
   - Add tests for remaining services and controllers
   - Implement integration tests for microservice communication

2. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation to reflect type changes
   - Document test coverage and testing strategies

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add automated testing to CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up linting to prevent `any` types in future code
